    <p>I earned my Bachelor's degree in Marine Engineering from a prestigious university in the United States. During my undergraduate years, I gained a solid foundation in engineering principles, maritime safety, and ship design. i had the privilege of working on various projects, collaborating with fellow students and professors, and honing my technical skills.</p>
    <p>Driven by a desire to deepen my knowledge and contribute to the advancement of marine engineering, I decided to pursue a Master's degree in the same field. I enrolled in a renowned graduate program, specializing in Naval Architecture and Marine Systems. This advanced degree allowed me to delve into complex subjects such as ship hydodynamics, marine propulsion systems, and offshore structures. I engaged in cutting-edge research, exploring innovative solutions for sustainable and efficient maritime opearations.</p>
